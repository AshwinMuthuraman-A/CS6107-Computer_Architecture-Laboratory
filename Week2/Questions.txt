CS6107 - Computer Architecture - Laboratory
Week 02

Questions:

1. Write an assembly language version of following C code segment:
	int A[100], B[100];
	for(i=1; i<100; i++) {
		A[i] = A[i-1] + B[i];
	}
   At the beginning of this code segment, the only values in registers are the base addresses of array A and array B in registers $a0 and $a1 respectively.
   
2. Convert the following C statement to equivalent MIPS assembly language. Assume that the variables f, g, h and i are assigned to registers $s0, $s1, $s2 and $s3. Assume that the base addresses of the array A and B are in registers $s6 and $s7 respectively
	a) f = g + B[4]
	b) f = g â€“ A[B[4]]

3. Write a MIPS program to print the factorial of a given number.
